## Game Title:
**Endangered Cake Museum**

## Brief Elevator Pitch Describing Game:
In a world where sugar has been outlawed, you control a child that has snuck into a museum at night in order to find a preserved cake for his/her upcoming birthday party - avoid getting detected by security guards as you find keys and navigate levels in this top down stealth game!

## Game Instructions:
Start the game via scene “0_Start”.
Interact with UI buttons by clicking on them.
Walk using W, A, S, and D keys. Sprint by holding shift. Toggle the flashlight by tapping the spacebar or by clicking. Turn the player by moving the mouse.
The objective is to complete each level by finding a key and opening the exit without alerting the guards. The final level has no key or exit, but rather a cake which is the end goal. Walk into keys and doors in order to interact with them.
The guards patrol between predetermined points. They detect the play with their light. If the player shines a light at them or collides with them, they turn toward the player.

## Available Content:
The game contains a title screen, 3 tutorial levels, 4 challenge levels, and a final reward level.
Some levels are prefaced by short tidbits of worldbuilding and story.
Each level contains 1 key and 1 exit door, besides level 5. Players will experience the entire game by beating levels in order and progressing through the story until they find the cake.

## Lessons Learned:
### Nicholas G
Working with others, as opposed to developing solo, leads to much greater creative output. My teammates designed levels and added features that I would not have imagined had I worked on the game alone.
Making game components and entities modular and easily customizable may take more work up front, but this streamlines building future levels & other aspects of the game later on. Thankfully, Unity is designed around this entity/component interaction and thus imposes better habits on game designers that use the engine.
Playtesting levels with people of various gaming capabilities is crucial in fully understanding the inherent difficulty of your game. Playing a level as a designer that knows the general layout, mechanics, and entity behavior is completely different from someone who is playing your game (or genre) for the first time.
### Nicholas D
I noticed that Game Engines feel difficult to learn starting out, but they get much simpler once you gain more experience using them, especially since we all already have the general coding experience.
It is very helpful to establish the core mechanics of your game early on because as new levels or ideas are generated, they can depend on your existing features, which can be a problem if things are not coded efficiently.
Having an increased level of convenience when creating games overall leaves a lot of room for more design rather than implementation. So, in Unity, when many objects can rely on a certain Component, this can make coding take much less time since a script can be applied to other objects simultaneously.
### Ryan
Game design is a complex and multifaceted process which requires a lot of time, patience, and skills of a large breadth.
Working in a team allows for the strengths of different developers to make up for the weaknesses of others; this is something that can go both ways.
Game design requires a lot of hard work, but it is very satisfying and rewarding.
The “yes- and” approach to group work is generally great, but sometimes compromises need to be made. Most projects need to be coherent and consistent.
### Simon
Unity is a powerful tool that allows you to easily create your vision of game mechanics and aesthetics. 
I learned that keeping your assets organized, saving often, and following a linear development path where you prioritize core features first increases efficiency.
I also learned that keeping work organized for the sake of collaboration is valuable. Collaboration increases the potential of any project, so to enhance it we can design so that it is intuitive for others to add to or modify our work.
